# Mon Bot

A Discord bot that spawns random Pokemon for users to catch! Type `ball` in chat when a Pokemon appears to catch it.

## Features

- üéÆ Random Pokemon spawning in designated channels
- ‚ö° Catch Pokemon by typing `ball` in chat
- üåê Multi-server support - each Discord server has independent configuration
- üîß Admin `/setup` command to configure spawn channels per server
- üìä Track your caught Pokemon with `/pokedex`
- üèÜ See your collection statistics with `/count`
- üíæ PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- üé® Pokemon data fetched from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Quick Start

1. **[Setup Instructions](SETUP.md)** - Complete installation and deployment guide
2. **Invite the bot to your Discord server**
3. **Run `/setup #channel`** to configure where Pokemon spawn
4. **Start catching!** Type `ball` when a Pokemon appears

## Commands

### Admin Commands
- **`/setup #channel`** - Configure which channel(s) Pokemon spawn in (Administrator only)

### User Commands
- **`ball`** - Catch a spawned Pokemon (type in chat when Pokemon appears)
- **`/pokedex [@user]`** - View your Pokedex or another user's
- **`/count`** - See how many of each Pokemon you've caught
- **`/help`** - Display bot commands and information

## How It Works

1. Pokemon randomly spawn in channels you configure with `/setup`
2. Each server administrator can configure their own spawn channels
3. Users catch Pokemon by typing `ball` when they appear
4. All catches are tracked in a PostgreSQL database
5. Each Discord server's data is completely independent
